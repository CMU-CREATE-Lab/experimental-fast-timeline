Explorations into a faster explorable timeline


iPhone 6 / Safari
-----------------
    1000 segments: 60 FPS
    5000 segments: 4 FPS, then speeds up to 20 FPS after a few second

iPhone 5 / Safari
-----------------
    Oddly, canvas seems to go well below the fold, so most traces are outside (below) the window
    1000 segments: 40 FPS
    5000 segments: 12 FPS

Nexus 7 / Chrome
----------------
    1000 segments: 16 FPS
    5000 segments: 4 FPS, and touch events seem to break
